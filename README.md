Basically a collection of examples created on-the-fly during classes. 

Remark: The source codes in this repository often entail "ugly" or not recommended solutions, e.g. making all members of a class as public, if the goal of the example was to illustrate and emphasize something else, and this shortcut was made to save time for the "important stuff".
